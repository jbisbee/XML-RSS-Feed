Revision history for Perl module XML::RSS::Feed

0.25 03/16/2004
	- added Clone 0.13 dependency
	- upped version to 0.25

0.2 01/27/2004
	- added new param 'tmpdir'.  The module will now attempt to load 
	  cached XML when this param is given.  The XML is held in memory
	  until the DESTROY method is called and the XML is written to the
	  tmpdir if it is defined.
	- better debugging if 'debug' is defined.

0.11 09/06/2003
	- issue with Module::Release

0.10 09/06/2003
	- moved XML::RSS::Feed::Headline into XML::RSS::Feed as XML::RSS::Headline
	- fixed a return code error on parse - was returning 0 on parse and should
	  returning 1 (this didn't really affect anything though)
	- added a 'hlobj' attribute so that you can subclass XML::RSS::Headline to
	  customize a headline.  An example of this is subclassing XML::RSS::Headline
	  to create a new headline method that takes advantage of the extra info
	  found with in the <item> xml block

		package PerlJobs;
		use strict;
		use XML::RSS::Feed;
		use base qw(XML::RSS::Headline);


		sub headline
		{
		    my ($self) = @_;
		    # no idea why they use 'http://jobs.perl.org/rss/' as a hash key
		    my $sub_hash = $self->{item}{'http://jobs.perl.org/rss/'};
		    return "$self->{item}{title}\n$sub_hash->{company_name} - " . 
			"$sub_hash->{location}\n" .  "$sub_hash->{hours}, " . 
			"$sub_hash->{employment_terms}";
		}

		1;

	  Which produced a more detailed headline than you would normally get.  This 
	  example is from rssbot on irc.perl.org in channel #news.

	      <rssbot>  + Part Time Perl
	      <rssbot>    Brian Koontz - United States, TX, Dallas
	      <rssbot>    Part time, Independent contractor (project-based)
	      <rssbot>    http://jobs.perl.org/job/950

	- removed _build_headline because this was fixed by sublcassing 
	  XML::RSS::Headline instead of XML::RSS::Feed;
	- changed late breaking news to use scalar instead of quote
	  
	    scalar @{$self->{late_breaking_news}}; 

	  instead of

	    "@{$self->{late_breaking_news}}"; 	         

0.01 03/19/2003
